				<h2> <span class="byline" >Censorship circumvention and encrypting your traffic with a VPN

</span></h2>
				<p>“Do I need a VPN?” and “Which VPN should I use?” are questions that often come up during digital security workshops. Learners might hear of Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, when they’re looking for ways to protect their Internet connection on public WiFi, such as at a coffee shop or in an airport. Others, like journalists, may want to use a VPN as a way of seeming like they are using a different network than the one that they are working from. Learners may also be interested in circumventing Internet censorship in their country. The question of how to know which VPN to use, however, is packed with additional considerations and nuances, and it may be difficult to address these in a clear way. This lesson plan helps learners think through what tools are right for them, and what factors they should consider in their search for a VPN.</p>

			<h2><strong>Question</strong> “I’m overwhelmed by information! Can’t you just recommend one VPN that you like?”</h2>
			<p><strong>Answer</strong> If there’s a VPN that you—the facilitator—like and have spent time assessing for your own uses, it may be okay to recommend it. However, we strongly encourage you to carefully consider how you recommend such a tool. Be sure to share the caveat that it is hard to assess the security and claims of VPNs, and that the security and privacy considerations for each VPN can change quickly. Encourage learners to stay informed by periodically searching for news involving their VPN.</p></div>
		<div id="fbox2">
			<h2><strong>Question</strong> “Why is it so hard to get my VPN to work?”

</h2>
			<p><strong>Answer </strong> A learner may ask this question out of frustration with usability or slow speeds. One possible response is: “The range and quality of VPNs varies a lot from one service to another. Just like email, who you choose as your VPN provider will impact the quality of service a lot.”

Consider returning to this question when discussing the advantages and disadvantages of dedicated VPN software.</p></div>
		<div id="fbox3">
			<h2><strong>Question</strong> “My workplace provides a VPN. Should I just use that?”

</h2>
			<p><strong>Answer</strong> Explain that whatever VPN you choose, you’re entrusting it to provide the Internet for you. You can give the following examples to illustrate the advantages and drawbacks of using a workplace VPN.</p>
<p>
“Connecting to a work VPN is a lot like connecting to your WiFi at work. While a workplace-provided VPN will protect against someone snooping on your connection in a coffee shop, it won’t be the best option if you, for example, choose to look at job listings for other companies, or if you want to reach out to a reporter about workplace misconduct. Just as your systems administrator at your workplace will see activity when you are on the network while physically at the office, they can also see your activity when you are connecting to the work VPN from anywhere outside of the office. The most important thing to keep in mind is that you’re shifting the trust from your ISP or WiFi point to the VPN itself.</p></div>
		<div id="fbox4">
			<h2><strong>Question</strong> “I can’t afford a monthly/yearly fee. What should I do? Should I download a free VPN?”

</h2>
			<p><strong>Answer</strong> To consolidate cost, you might suggest using a VPN that is packaged with other security software. Some VPN services require you have an account with them first, but offer a VPN service for free when you are referenced by another user. There are other free VPN services available, too.</p>
			<P>

You can say something along the lines of: “The most important thing when investigating a free VPN service is determining how they are able to operate for free.  Are they selling your data? If so, are you comfortable with this trade-off? In some instances, free VPNs may have malicious advertising (sometimes called “malvertising”) incorporated in their software.”</p>
